## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Tashkent**, also known as Toshkent, is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan. 
> It is the most populous city in Central Asia, 
> with a population of more than 3 million people as of April 1, 2024. 
> It is located in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with Kazakhstan.
>
> Before the influence of Islam in the mid-8th century AD, 
> Sogdian and Turkic culture was predominant. 
> 
> After Genghis Khan destroyed the city in 1219, 
> it was rebuilt and profited from its location on the Silk Road. 
> 
> From the 18th to the 19th centuries, the city became an independent city-state, 
> before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. 
> 
> In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian Empire; as a result, 
> it became the capital of Russian Turkestan. 
> 
> In Soviet times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes 
> due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. 
> 
> Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, 
> but it was soon rebuilt as a model Soviet city. 
> 
> It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, 
> after Moscow, Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) and Kiev (now Kyiv).
>
> Tashkent plays a central role in the country's economic and human development. 
> As of 2024, it recorded the highest HDI among Uzbekistan's regions, with a score of 0.840, 
> reflecting significant progress in education, healthcare, and living standards. 
> 
> Economically, Tashkent was the leading contributor to the national GDP, 
> accounting for 19% of Uzbekistan’s GDP in the first half of 2024. 
> 
> This economic dominance is supported by ongoing infrastructure development 
> and urban modernization projects aimed at enhancing its role as a financial and commercial hub. 
> 
> Nonetheless, the city faces challenges such as environmental concerns 
> and the need for sustainable investment in public services.
>
> Since Uzbekistan gained independence, Tashkent has retained its multiethnic population, 
> with ethnic Uzbeks forming the majority. 
> 
> In 2009, it celebrated 2,200 years of its written history. 
> The master plan of Tashkent until 2045 was approved.
